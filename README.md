# AutomateTheBoringStuff
Going through the book and udemy tutorial with the same name
I never went through a tutorial for python to the end. That is
why many best practices were fully utilised by me. I want to change
that and also get some good programming habits along the way. This
is going to be the start of it.

## Structure
Some chapters have implementation tasks. Each chapter will have its own
folder if there are implementation tasks to complete. I will do some
"off the books" stuff I find on different python platforms that I find
interesting or just want to try out myself. These are going straight to
the "learning_experiments" folder. Feel free to take a look in this repository,
although I think it is not going to be very interesting for anyone besides me.
